# Decipher Open Source Labs

A marketing research services provider, [Decipher](http://www.decipherinc.com/) specializes in online survey programming, data collection, data processing/reporting and custom technology development. Utilizing Web-based applications, Decipher integrates state of the art technology with traditional research techniques. Decipher's survey tools and data reporting suite provide users with the ability to automate post field production, significantly increasing the accuracy and quality of research reporting.

## What's here?

Decipher's development department, besides creating proprietary software, often creates reusable components, libraries, toolkits, widgets, and other flimflam that we think might be of use to the rest of humanity.  Here, we'll host some of those projects.

## Hosted Projects

### [Tagify](http://decipherinc.github.io/tagify/)

A simple UI control to turn any text input into a "tagified" UI control. The value of the input will be split on the specified delimiter and create one tag for each item in the list.

### [angular-reol](https://github.com/decipherinc/angular-reol/)

Fork of [Reol.js](https://npmjs.org/package/reol) to AngularJS.  Reol.js is a node package and thus does not work client-side.

### [angular-history](https://github.com/decipherinc/angular-history/)

A history service for AngularJS. Undo/redo, that sort of thing. Has nothing to do with the "back" button, unless you want it to.

### [angular-tipped](https://github.com/decipherinc/angular-tipped/)

AngularJS directive to assist with using the [Tipped](http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped) jQuery plugin from Nick Stakenburg.

### [angular-tags](http://decipherinc.github.io/angular-tags/)

Pure AngularJS tagging widget with typeahead support courtesy of [ui-bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap)
