Utilizing Web-based applications, Decipher integrates state of the art technology with traditional research techniques. Decipher's survey tools and data reporting suite provide users with the ability to automate post field production, significantly increasing the accuracy and quality of research reporting.\r\n\r\n## What's here?\r\n\r\nDecipher's development department, besides creating proprietary software, often creates reusable components, libraries, toolkits, widgets, and other flimflam that we think might be of use to the rest of humanity.  Here, we'll host some of those projects.\r\n\r\nWe work mainly in Python and JavaScript, so the code is likely going to come in one or both of those formats.  We prefer the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) for our code, but not all projects may have this license.\r\n\r\n## Hosted Projects\r\n\r\n### [Tagify](http://decipherinc.github.com/tagify/)\r\n\r\nA simple UI control to turn any text input into a \"tagified\" UI control.
