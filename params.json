Undo/redo, that sort of thing. Has nothing to do with the \"back\" button, unless you want it to.\r\n\r\n### [angular-tipped](https://github.com/decipherinc/angular-tipped/)\r\n\r\nAngularJS directive to assist with using the [Tipped](http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped) jQuery plugin from Nick Stakenburg.\r\n\r\n### [angular-tags](http://decipherinc.github.io/angular-tags/)\r\n\r\nPure AngularJS tagging widget with typeahead support courtesy of [ui-bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap)\r\n\r\n## Questions about Decipher Open Source Labs?\r\n\r\nPlease direct all communication to Dr. @boneskull, who manages the laboratory.\r\n","google":"UA-39154813-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
